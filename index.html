            <div class="project-tile">
                <div class="project-title">"First Landing Page" Project</div>
                <p>This was the first project assigned by the Odin Project curriculum. It allowed me to 
                    follow on the basics of HTML and CSS that I learned. The page was quite simple, although the use of 
                    flexbox was very interesting.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-tile">
                <div class="project-title">"Rock-Paper-Scissors" Project</div>
                <p>At this point I was already getting more advanced. I basically recreated a Rock-Paper-Scissors game by using
                    HTML, CSS and Javascript. The logic was definitely now simple, and I needed a bit of time to get it sorted. Nevertheless,
                    the overall result was fairly creative, and without so many bugs...
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-tile">
                <div class="project-title">"ETCH-A-SKETCH" Project</div>
                <p>OK, so I remember this one. I needed a breakthrough moment due to not being able to properly resize the drawing grid based on
                    user input. I remember wanting to ask the Discord community for help, although while looking for the 18th time at the code, I 
                finally realized what I had to do. It was definitely a very good feeling to have.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-tile">
                <div class="project-title">"Calculator" Project</div>
                <p>Ah, yes, the good old calculator. This was a bit annoying, I remember almost restarting it completely after about 6 hours of work. I thought the 
                    Javascript logic I applied was not good, although in the end I didn't need to do such a drastic refactoring. This project has to be revised as 
                    the CSS is not at all pretty, and there's a bug - if you type a number starting with "0" the calculator won't work!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-tile">
                <div class="project-title">"Sign Up Form" Project</div>
                <p>Honestly, I didn't enjoy at all the data validation part. Especially because I struggled a bit with the regex patterns and password checking. I once again have to revisit these materials,
                    in order to fill fully confident. Nevertheless, after playing quite a lot with various designs, I settled for something that in the end wasn't bad at all. At least 
                that's what I think.

                <div class="project-title">"Dashboard" Project</div>
                <p>Well, I guess there's not a lot to say here. You're looking at it right now. :) </p>
